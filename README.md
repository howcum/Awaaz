A Text To Speech Converting App

This project was done in the "Software Development sessional (Android)" course. This was my very first project in Android or any kind of development platform.

So natuarally it does not have a great UI nor does it have good quality of code.

Features:
1. English Text to Speech- for this google tts API was used. 
2. Bengali Text to Speech- implemented a brute force word level conversion. Frequently used 300 words were stored.
